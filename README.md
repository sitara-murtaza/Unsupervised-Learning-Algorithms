# Unsupervised-Learning-Algorithms
These are unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering and anomaly detection. K-Means divides data into fixed clusters using centroids. DBSCAN forms density-based clusters and detects noise. Hierarchical clustering builds clusters stepwise. Gaussian Mixture Model uses probabilities for clustering. Isolation Forest finds outliers effectively now.
